# Let It Snow! Falling Snow Animation

This Christmas Online Animated Musical Card was made using Javascript & p5.js library.

If you never heard about p5.js, it is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source. (https://p5js.org/)

I used to love create games & animations with help of p5.js at the beginning of my web dev journey.
Thanks to this library I've started learning JavaScript along Khan Academy online courses & felt in love with coding in December 2020.

I've made a few games & animations with this library a few years ago, like *Old School 2D Racing Game* ðŸ‘‰ https://vadimgierko.github.io/old-school-2d-racing-game/). Also I've built *MindMaps App* with p5 (try this app here: https://vadimgierko.github.io/MIND-MAP-APP/).

I encourage you to give p5.js a try!

`I wish you a Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year! Let it snow!`

## Realistic 3D illusion & perspective

To make the animation seem more realistic, I created a pseudo 3D illusion thanks to basic knowledge of perspective:
- there are 3 layers of snow
- more distant snowflakes are smaller, while closer are larger
- more distant snowflakes fall slower, and closer ones fall faster
