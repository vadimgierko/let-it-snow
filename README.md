# let-it-snow

Falling Snow Animation made using p5.js library. This Christmas Online Card was made just fo fun ;-) Let it snow!

## Realistic 3D illusion & perspective

To make the animation seem more realistic, I created a pseudo 3D illusion thanks to basic knowledge of perspective:
- there are 3 layers of snow
- more distant snowflakes are smaller, while closer are larger
- more distant snowflakes fall slower, and closer ones fall faster
