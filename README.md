# Let It Snow! Falling Snow Animation

This Christmas Online Animated Musical Card was made using Javascript & p5.js library.

If you never heard about p5.js, it is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source. (https://p5js.org/)

I love create games & animations with help of p5.js. Thanks to this library I've started learning JavaScript & felt in love with coding one year ago (Khan Academy online courses). I've made a few games & animations with this library (see my Old School 2D Racing Game here https://vadimgierko.github.io/old-school-2d-racing-game/). Also I've developed Mind Maps App with p5 (try this app here: https://vadimgierko.github.io/MIND-MAP-APP/). I encourage you to try p5.js!

`I wish you a Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year! Let it snow!`

## Realistic 3D illusion & perspective

To make the animation seem more realistic, I created a pseudo 3D illusion thanks to basic knowledge of perspective:
- there are 3 layers of snow
- more distant snowflakes are smaller, while closer are larger
- more distant snowflakes fall slower, and closer ones fall faster

### To do:
[X] optimize trees 3D illusion & perspective
[X] auto window resizing
[X] relocate trees groups due to resized window
